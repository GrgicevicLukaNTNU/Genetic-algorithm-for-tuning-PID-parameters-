# Description
The genetic algorithm implemented in Matlab for tuning PID parameters of a second-order system with a hard nonlinearity (called from Simulink). The objective function is an integral of time-weighted signal error (setpoint is one). Solver is [ga](https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/ga.html/), and the parameters are initialized provisionally. A video of a search is included.
